This analysis assumes the data is valid and reliable, which may not necessarily hold true.\nFurthermore, the assumptions underlying the statistical tests were not explicitly verified. For simplicity, it was presumed that the data satisfies all necessary assumptions. Consequently, the validity of the statistical test results may be compromised."

    "text": "Methods\nApproach and Procedure Method\nThis study employed the hypothetical-deductive method, also known as the method of conjecture and refutation (Popper, 1972/1979, p. 164), as its problem-solving approach. Procedurally, it applied an enhanced version of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), grounded on the original ideas of Neyman-Pearson framework for data testing (Neyman & Pearson, 1928a, 1928b; Perezgonzalez, 2015).\nThe analysis was conducted using a t-test for independent samples alongside visual inspections of the data.\nAdditionally, a power analysis and effect-size estimation were performed to ensure the robustness and practical significance of the results.\nSource of Data/Information\nThe data used in this analysis were sourced from Brazil’s Food and Nutrition Surveillance System (SISVAN), regarding the dataset on ultra-processed food consumption (Sistema de Vigilância Alimentar e Nutricional, n.d.).\nOnly data from municipalities with 10 or more monitored children were considered in the analysis.\nData Wrangling\nData munging and analysis followed the data science workflow outlined by Wickham et al. (2023), as illustrated in Figure 1. All processes were made using the R programming language (R Core Team, n.d.), RStudio IDE (Posit Team, n.d.), and several R packages.\nThe tidyverse and rOpenSci peer-reviewed package ecosystem and other R packages adherents of the tidy tools manifesto (Wickham, 2023) were prioritized. All processes were made in order to provide result transparency and reproducibility.\n\n\nFigure 1: Data science workflow created by Wickham, Çetinkaya-Runde, and Grolemund.\n\n\nSource: Reproduced from Wickham et al. (2023).\n\n\n\nThe Tidyverse code style guide and design principles were followed to ensure consistency and enhance readability.\nAll the analyses are 100% reproducible and can be run again at any time. See the README file in the code repository to learn how to run them.\nHypothesis Testing\nWe tested whether the means of ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 differed meaningfully across the clusters B and D of the Revised Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems (MISFS-R).\nTo ensure practical significance, we applied a Minimum Effect Size (MES) criterion, following the original Neyman-Pearson framework for hypothesis testing (Neyman & Pearson, 1928a, 1928b; Perezgonzalez, 2015). The MES was set at Cohen’s threshold for small effects (Cohen’s \\(d\\) = 0.2) (Cohen, 1988). Thus, a difference was considered meaningfully only if its effect-size was greater or equal to the MES; otherwise, it was considered negligible.\nThe test was structured as follows:\n\nNull Hypothesis (\\(\\text{H}_{0}\\)): Ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 does not differ meaningfully across MISFS-R clusters B and D, indicated by Cohen’s \\(d\\) effect-size statistic being smaller than \\(0.2\\) (negligible) or by a non-significant t-statistic (with a Type I error probability (\\(\\alpha\\)) of \\(0.05\\)).\nAlternative Hypothesis (\\(\\text{H}_{a}\\)): Ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 differs meaningfully across MISFS-R clusters B and D, indicated by Cohen’s \\(d\\) effect-size statistic being greater or equal than \\(0.2\\) (non-negligible) and by a significant t-statistic (with a Type I error probability (\\(\\alpha\\)) of \\(0.05\\)).\n\nFormally:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{H}_{0}: \\text{Cohen's} \\ d &lt; \\text{MES} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\text{t-statistic is not significant} \\ (\\alpha \\geq 0.05) \\\\\n\\text{H}_{a}: \\text{Cohen's} \\ d \\geq \\text{MES} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{t-statistic is significant} \\ (\\alpha &lt; 0.05)\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nInterpretation of Results\nRevised Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems (MISFS-R)\nMISFS is a multidimensional index designed to assess the sustainability of food systems at a subnational level in Brazil, incorporating local behaviors and practices. The MISFS-R is a revised version that introduces new indicators and a refined methodology (Figure 2). For more details, see Carvalho et al. (2021) and Norde et al. (2023).\n\n\nFigure 2: Dendrogram for cluster analysis between Brazilian states considering all the Revised Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems (MISFS-R) indicators and geographical location of each cluster.\n\n\nSource: Reproduced from Norde et al. (2023).\n\n\n\nPratical Significance\nTo ensure practical significance, we used Cohen’s \\(d\\) statistic small size benchmark as a reference. This statistic was analyzed considering a confidence interval of \\(95\\%\\).\nWe emphasize the need for the use of a MES while conducting hypothesis tests, since a p-value does not measure effect size; rather, it represents the conditional probability of observing the test statistic (or a more extreme value) given that the null hypothesis is true (Cohen, 1994; Wasserstein & Lazar, 2016)."

The effect size was very small and did not exceed the Minimal Effect Size (MES) threshold (Hedges’ \\(g\\) = 0.06, 95% CI [-0.12, 0.25]), suggesting that any potential difference is likely negligible. Hedges’ \\(g\\) is interpreted similarly to Cohen’s \\(d\\).\nThe test had low power (1 - \\(\\beta\\) = 0.123), meaning a high probability of failing to detect a true difference if one exists (\\(\\beta\\) = 0.877). Given the low statistical power and the small effect size, the evidence is insufficient to support a meaningful difference in ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 across clusters B and D."
