  abstract = {The sustainability of food systems is commonly measured at the global or national level using multidimensional indices. However, it is not possible to use such indices at subnational levels, because the data for many indicators are not available and large countries such as Brazil have completely different food systems depending on the state or region considered. This paper presents a sustainable food systems framework for Brazil and the Brazilian Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems (MISFS), which is the first index of its kind that considers local behaviors and actions to rank states and regions of the country. The dimensions and indicators included in the index were identified from a literature review and an exclusion criteria, which considered the Brazilian context, that ended up with 17 indicators divided in three dimensions (environmental, socioeconomic, and nutritional). We followed well-known procedures to create an interpretable multidimensional index, which include normalization, weighting, aggregating, and sensitivity analysis. The performance of the states was starkly different, regarding the indicators and dimensions considered. No state presented a high score for all three dimensions, and even states with a high MISFS score had room to improve in one or two dimensions. In general, high-income states scored well on socioeconomic indicators (e.g., agriculture education), but poorly on most environmental indicators (e.g., water footprint), and some nutritional indicators (e.g., obesity rate). This index is the first initiative to measure the Brazilian food systems according to local practices and behaviors at state level and it is a starting point to help policymakers understand the opportunities of improvement of their food systems. This study may also help other countries to develop their own frameworks and strategies to improve their regionalized food systems.},

  abstract = {Countries with large territories marked by heterogeneity lack tools to monitor their distinct food systems sustainability. The multidimensional index for sustainable food systems (MISFS) was designed to measure food system sustainability locally, using the Brazilian territory. The aim was two-fold: to present the MISFS updating process (MISFS-R), and to show the applicability of MISFS-R to uncover local geopolitical priorities. Methods: Based on a systematized review and sensitivity analysis, 46 indicators were selected to compose the MISFS-R social, nutritional, environmental, and economic dimensions. Official Brazilian datasets allowed the MISFS-R scoring for 26 Brazilian states and capitals. Correlations between MISFS-R dimensions were analyzed by Spearman's coefficient. A cluster analysis was used to check for Brazilian states similarities and priorities. Findings: Economic and environmental performance were inversely related, while economic performance was directly related to social and nutritional scores. Four clusters were formed with marked differences in their food systems sustainability profile.},

  abstract = {Despite frequent calls for the overhaul of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), this controversial procedure remains ubiquitous in behavioral, social and biomedical teaching and research. Little change seems possible once the procedure becomes well ingrained in the minds and current practice of researchers; thus, the optimal opportunity for such change is at the time the procedure is taught, be this at undergraduate or at postgraduate levels. This paper presents a tutorial for the teaching of data testing procedures, often referred to as hypothesis testing theories. The first procedure introduced is Fisher's approach to data testing—tests of significance; the second is Neyman-Pearson's approach—tests of acceptance; the final procedure is the incongruent combination of the previous two theories into the current approach—NSHT. For those researchers sticking with the latter, two compromise solutions on how to improve NHST conclude the tutorial.},
