## Overview

This report presents a data analysis exercise for the course [An Introduction to the R Programming Language](https://github.com/danielvartan/r-course).

The analysis explores potential differences in ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022, focusing on clusters B and D of the Revised Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems ([MISFS-R](https://doi.org/10.1002/sd.2376)).

This exercise is for **educational purposes only**.

The assumptions underlying the statistical test were not verified. For simplicity, we assumed that the data meets all necessary assumptions. As a result, the statistical test results may not be valid.

## Question

This analysis seeks to address the following question:

::: {style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; padding-top: 30px;"}
Was there a [**meaningful**]{.brand-red} difference in [**ultra-processed food consumption**]{.brand-red} among Brazilian children aged [**2 to 4**]{.brand-red} in [**2022**]{.brand-red} across the [**clusters B and D**]{.brand-red} of the Revised Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems ([MISFS-R](https://doi.org/10.1002/sd.2376))?

## Methods

### Approach and Procedure Method

This study employed the hypothetical-deductive method, also known as the method of conjecture and refutation [@popper1979a, p. 164], as its problem-solving approach. Procedurally, it applied an enhanced version of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), grounded on the original ideas of Neyman-Pearson framework for data testing [@neyman1928; @neyman1928a; @perezgonzalez2015].

The analysis was conducted using a [t-test for independent samples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) alongside visual inspections of the data.

Additionally, a power analysis and effect-size estimation were performed to ensure the robustness and practical significance of the results.

### Source of Data/Information

The data used in this analysis were sourced from Brazil's Food and Nutrition Surveillance System ([SISVAN](https://sisaps.saude.gov.br/sisvan/)), regarding the dataset on ultra-processed food consumption [@sisvanb].

Only data from municipalities with 10 or more monitored children were considered in the analysis.

### Data Wrangling

Data munging and analysis followed the data science workflow outlined by @wickham2023e, as illustrated in [@fig-wickham-at-al-2024-figure-1]. All processes were made using the R programming language [@rcoreteama], RStudio IDE [@positteama], and several R packages.

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) peer-reviewed package ecosystem and other R packages adherents of the tidy tools manifesto [@wickham2023c] were prioritized. All processes were made in order to provide result transparency and reproducibility.

:::

The Tidyverse [code style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) and [design principles](https://design.tidyverse.org/) were followed to ensure consistency and enhance readability.

All the analyses are 100% reproducible and can be run again at any time. See the [README](hhttps://github.com/danielvartan/r-course-exercise/blob/main/README.md) file in the code repository to learn how to run them.

### Hypothesis Testing

We tested whether the means of ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 differed meaningfully across the clusters B and D of the Revised Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems (MISFS-R).

To ensure practical significance, we applied a Minimum Effect Size (MES) criterion, following the original Neyman-Pearson framework for hypothesis testing [@neyman1928; @neyman1928a; @perezgonzalez2015]. The MES was set at Cohen's threshold for small effects (Cohen's $d$ = 0.2) [@cohen1988a]. Thus, a difference was considered meaningfully only if its effect-size was greater or equal to the MES; otherwise, it was considered negligible.

The test was structured as follows:

- **Null Hypothesis** ($\text{H}_{0}$): Ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 does not differ meaningfully across MISFS-R clusters B and D, indicated by Cohen's $d$ effect-size statistic being smaller than $0.2$ (negligible) **or** by a non-significant t-test (with a Type I error probability ($\alpha$) of $0.05$).

- **Alternative Hypothesis** ($\text{H}_{a}$): Ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 differs meaningfully across MISFS-R clusters B and D, indicated by Cohen's $d$ effect-size statistic being greater or equal than $0.2$ (non-negligible) **and** by a significant t-test (with a Type I error probability ($\alpha$) of $0.05$).

Formally:

$$
\begin{cases}
\text{H}_{0}: \text{Cohen's} \ d < \text{MES} \quad \text{or} \quad \text{t-test is not significant} \ (\alpha \geq 0.05) \\
\text{H}_{a}: \text{Cohen's} \ d \geq \text{MES} \quad \text{and} \quad \text{t-test is significant} \ (\alpha < 0.05)
\end{cases}
$$

### Interpretation of Results

#### Revised Multidimensional Index for Sustainable Food Systems (MISFS-R)

MISFS is a multidimensional index designed to assess the sustainability of food systems at a subnational level in Brazil, incorporating local behaviors and practices. The MISFS-R is a revised version that introduces new indicators and a refined methodology ([@fig-norde-2023-figure-6]). For more details, see @carvalho2021a and @norde2023.

:::

#### Pratical Significance

To ensure practical significance, we used Cohen's $d$ statistic small size benchmark as a reference. This statistic was analyzed considering a confidence interval of $95\%$.

We emphasize the need for the use of a MES while conducting hypothesis tests, since a p-value does not measure effect size; rather, it represents the conditional probability of observing the test statistic (or a more extreme value) given that the null hypothesis is true [@cohen1994; @wasserstein2016].

  paired = FALSE,
  n2 = length(misfs_d),
  kappa = length(misfs_b) / length(misfs_d),
  power = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  welch.df = TRUE,
  alternative = "not equal"
)
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false

power.t.test(
  ncp = pwr_analysis$ncp,
  df = pwr_analysis$df,
  alpha = 0.05,
  alternative = "not equal",
  plot = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

## Conclusion

Our analysis indicates that the difference in means was not statistically significant ($t$ = 0.789, $p$ = 0.384). The effect size was very small and did not exceed the Minimal Effect Size (MES) threshold (Hedges' $g$ = 0.06, 95% CI [-0.12, 0.25]), suggesting that any potential difference is likely negligible. Hedges' $g$ is interpreted similarly to Cohen's $d$.

The test had low power (1 - $\beta$ = 0.123), meaning a high probability of failing to detect a true difference if one exists ($\beta = 0.877$). Given the low statistical power and the small effect size, [**the evidence is insufficient**]{.brand-red} to support a meaningful difference in ultra-processed food consumption among Brazilian children aged 2 to 4 in 2022 across clusters B and D.
